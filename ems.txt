What to be revised and organized
---------------------------------

1) The abstract of the report lack the explanation of rolling optimization (bridging HA and DA).
2) 

Code in github folder contains the following

README: show the report abstact + some example figures

folder 
1) input_data
	1.1) raw data
	1.2) processed data (downsampled, batch datasets)
2) ems_module_python
	2.1) function that read input data and prepare system parameter (to be input for EMS)
	2.2) core function that solves EMS optimization
	2.3) function that read solution from 2.2) and plot the results
	2.4) demo notebook: script that show how to call 2.1)-2.3) from head to end. The notebook should have many examples (calling several combinations of objectives)
	
3) ems_module_matlab: similar to python version. The key component 2.2) in matlab version must be prepared (check the correctness too. does it return the same answer as python version)

4) ems_experiments
	4.1) economical objective
	4.2) multiple batteries
	4.3) smooth charge --> provide trade-off curve, pareto front
	4.4) islanding mode
	
5) results
	5.1) all generated figures used in the report
	5.2) codes to generate such figures
	5.3) processed results that produce the figures
